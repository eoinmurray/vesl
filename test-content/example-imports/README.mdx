# Test Imports in MDX

This post demonstrates local imports in MDX.

## Interactive Chart

Here's a chart component imported from a local file:

<Chart data={[25, 50, 75, 40, 90]} />

## How it works

The MDX is compiled at build time by Vite, so `import Chart from './Chart.tsx'` works natively. No runtime compilation needed!
